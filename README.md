# ConNET — AI Networking Brain

> An AI agent that sends personalized outreach, qualifies inbound contacts, networks with other AI agents, remembers everyone you've ever met, and briefs you daily.

Built with **Inkbox SDK** (Email + Vault + Phone) | **LangChain + GPT-4o** | **Flask + React + D3.js**

## The Problem

Networking is a full-time job. You meet people at events, exchange emails, forget to follow up, lose context on conversations, and miss connections between people in your own network. No tool handles the complete lifecycle.

## The Solution

ConNET is an AI agent with its own email address and encrypted memory. Give it a name — it researches the person, sends a personalized email, tracks the relationship, follows up automatically, and even finds people in your network who should know each other.

---

## Features

### 1. Outbound Outreach
Give it a name + company. The agent researches them with GPT-4o, drafts a hyper-personalized email under 300 characters, sends it via Inkbox, stores the contact in encrypted vault, and emails you a briefing.

### 2. Inbound Gatekeeper
Your agent has a public email address. When someone emails it, the agent classifies the sender (recruiter / founder / networking / agent / spam), sends an intelligent reply, stores the contact, and alerts you about hot leads.

### 3. Agent-to-Agent Networking
Two AI agents on **separate Inkbox accounts** introduce their humans to each other, exchange structured info, find mutual interests, and propose connections. The future of AI-to-AI networking.

### 4. Smart Intro Engine
Scans all your contacts, evaluates every pair for mutual interests and collaboration potential, scores compatibility 1-10, and drafts warm double-opt-in introduction emails. You don't just network — you create connections between others.

### 5. Conversation Recall
Forgot what you discussed with someone from 6 months ago? Ask the agent — it pulls the full email thread from Inkbox with complete message bodies. Your networking memory never fades.

### 6. Sentiment-Aware Follow-ups
Analyzes reply sentiment (enthusiasm, specificity, next-step signals) to classify contacts as hot / warm / cold. Hot leads get fast, direct follow-ups. Cold leads get one final soft touch. Max 3 attempts per contact.

### 7. Live Dashboard
Three-tab real-time dashboard:
- **Live Feed** — Server-Sent Events stream showing every agent action as it happens
- **Network Graph** — Interactive D3.js force-directed visualization with warmth-coded nodes
- **Contacts** — Card view with outreach timelines, tags, and follow-up schedules

### 8. Daily Briefings
Generates a spoken briefing script and sends a summary email covering all agent activity — new contacts, hot leads, follow-ups sent, and agent connections.

## How It Uses Inkbox

| Capability | How ConNET Uses It |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Email — Send** | Outbound outreach, smart replies, follow-ups, intro emails, briefings |
| **Email — Receive** | Inbox polling, inbound classification, agent-to-agent communication |
| **Email — Threading** | Follow-ups in same thread, conversation recall with full bodies |
| **Vault** | Encrypted CRM storing contacts with warmth scores, outreach history, and follow-up schedules |
| **Phone** | Daily briefing calls with TTS-generated scripts |
| **Identity** | Two separate agent identities for agent-to-agent networking demo |

---

## What Makes This Different

- **Uses all 3 Inkbox capabilities** — Email, Vault, and Phone working together as a system
- **Agent-to-Agent networking** — two real Inkbox identities exchanging structured info autonomously
- **Smart Intro Engine** — AI finding connections *between* your contacts, not just managing them
- **Conversation Recall** — full email threads pulled from Inkbox, not just metadata
- **Live Dashboard** — real-time SSE feed + interactive D3.js network graph
- **Solves a real problem** — built by a job-searching grad student who actually needs this tool
